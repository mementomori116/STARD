# STARD
Python code for STAR*D data secondary analysis
* .ipynb files are copies of my local iPython notebooks, stripped of outputs to protect the data
* strip.py is the python function I am using to strip my iPython files of data; the function works by modifying the backend json files such that all output cell keys are replaced with empty arrays
